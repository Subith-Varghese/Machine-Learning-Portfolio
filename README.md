## 🎓 Student Performance Predictor
https://github.com/Subith-Varghese/student_performance_predictor

Predict students’ Math scores based on demographic and academic features using ML regression models.

### Key Features
- 📥 Dataset downloaded from Kaggle
- 🔤 Handles categorical (one-hot) & numerical features (scaling)
- 🧑‍💻 Trains multiple regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
- 🌐 Web deployment via Flask for real-time predictions
- 📊 Detailed EDA, visualizations, and feature insights

#### Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | CatBoost | Matplotlib/Seaborn | Flask

### Workflow
1. Download dataset → data preprocessing → train-test split
2. Model training & evaluation → hyperparameter tuning
3. Save best model & preprocessor → prediction pipeline
4. Deploy via Flask app → user inputs → Math score prediction

#### Example Inputs
- Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch Type, Test Prep, Reading & Writing scores

#### Example Output
- Predicted Math Score: 78 / 100
